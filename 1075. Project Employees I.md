# Average Employee Experience per Project

This document includes schema definitions, sample data, and multiple query solutions for different SQL dialects and Pandas. The goal is to compute the average experience (in years) of employees for each project, rounded to two decimal places.

## SQL Schema and Data

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Project (
    project_id INT,
    employee_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (
    employee_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(10),
    experience_years INT
);
```

### Data

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Project;
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES (1, 3);
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES (2, 1);
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES (2, 4);

TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) VALUES (1, 'Khaled', 3);
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) VALUES (2, 'Ali', 2);
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) VALUES (3, 'John', 1);
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) VALUES (4, 'Doe', 2);
```

## Query Solutions

### MySQL 8.0

```sql
-- Method 1: LEFT JOIN
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;

-- Method 2: INNER JOIN
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;
```

### Microsoft SQL Server 2019

```sql
-- Method 1: Using GROUP BY
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years * 1.0), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;

-- Method 2: Using WINDOW function and DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years * 1.0) OVER (PARTITION BY p.project_id), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p 
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id;
```

### Oracle SQL 11.2

```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;
```

### PostgreSQL 16

```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years)::NUMERIC, 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
JOIN 
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id;
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 4]]
project = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['project_id', 'employee_id']).astype({
    'project_id': 'Int64',
    'employee_id': 'Int64'
})

data = [[1, 'Khaled', 3], [2, 'Ali', 2], [3, 'John', 1], [4, 'Doe', 2]]
employee = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['employee_id', 'name', 'experience_years']).astype({
    'employee_id': 'Int64',
    'name': 'object',
    'experience_years': 'Int64'
})
```

## Pandas Query

```python
def project_employees_i(project: pd.DataFrame, employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Merge project and employee tables on employee_id
    merged_df = pd.merge(project, employee, on='employee_id')
    
    # Group by project_id and calculate the rounded average experience_years
    result = (
        merged_df.groupby('project_id')['experience_years']
        .mean()
        .round(2)
        .reset_index(name='average_years')
    )
    
    return result
```
