# Delete Duplicate Emails - SQL and Pandas Solutions

This document provides multiple database-specific solutions (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL) and Pandas (Python) to delete duplicate email records from a `Person` table or DataFrame, keeping the record with the smallest `id`.

---

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Person (
    Id INT,
    Email VARCHAR(255)
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Person;

INSERT INTO Person (id, email) VALUES 
    (1, 'john@example.com'),
    (2, 'bob@example.com'),
    (3, 'john@example.com');
```

## MySQL Solution

### Method 1: Using self-join
```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;
```

### Method 2: Using explicit JOIN syntax
```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
  ON p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;
```

---

## MS SQL Server Solution

### Method 1: Using `NOT IN` with `GROUP BY`
```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(Id)
  FROM Person
  GROUP BY Email
);
```

---

## Oracle SQL Solution

### Method 1: Using `ROW_NUMBER()`
```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id IN (
  SELECT Id FROM (
    SELECT Id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY Id) AS rn
    FROM Person
  )
  WHERE rn > 1
);
```

---

## PostgreSQL Solution

### Method 1: Using `ROW_NUMBER()` in a subquery
```sql
DELETE FROM Person p
WHERE Id IN (
  SELECT Id FROM (
    SELECT Id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY Id) AS rn
    FROM Person
  ) sub
  WHERE rn > 1
);
```

---

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 'john@example.com'],
    [2, 'bob@example.com'],
    [3, 'john@example.com']
]

person = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['id', 'email']).astype({'id':'int64', 'email':'object'})
```

---

## Pandas Solution

### Method 1: Using `drop_duplicates()` after sorting
```python
def delete_duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    person.sort_values(by='id', inplace=True)
    person.drop_duplicates(subset='email', keep='first', inplace=True)
```

### Method 2: Using `groupby().idxmin()`
```python
def delete_duplicate_emails_v2(person: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return person.loc[person.groupby('email')['id'].idxmin()].sort_values(by='id').reset_index(drop=True)
```

---

## Notes

- In all SQL queries, the goal is to remove duplicate emails, keeping the record with the smallest `id`.
- For Pandas, the operation is in-place unless returned as a new DataFrame.
