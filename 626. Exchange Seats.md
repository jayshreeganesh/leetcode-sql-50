# Seat Swap Problem – SQL and Pandas Solutions

This README provides SQL schema, data inserts, and multiple solutions for different SQL dialects (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL), along with equivalent implementations using Pandas in Python.

---

## SQL Schema and Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Seat (
    id INT,
    student VARCHAR(255)
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Seat;

INSERT INTO Seat (id, student) VALUES
(1, 'Abbot'),
(2, 'Doris'),
(3, 'Emerson'),
(4, 'Green'),
(5, 'Jeames');
```

## MySQL Solutions

### Method 1

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

### Method 2

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) AND id % 2 = 1 THEN id
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 THEN id + 1
        ELSE id - 1
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

## MS SQL Server Solutions

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

## Oracle SQL Solutions

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Solutions

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 'Abbot'],
    [2, 'Doris'],
    [3, 'Emerson'],
    [4, 'Green'],
    [5, 'Jeames']
]

seat = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['id', 'student']).astype({'id': 'Int64', 'student': 'object'})
```

---

## Pandas Solutions

### Method 1 – Using Loop Swapping

```python
def exchange_seats(seat: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    seat = seat.sort_values("id").reset_index(drop=True)

    for i in range(0, len(seat) - 1, 2):
        seat.loc[i, 'student'], seat.loc[i + 1, 'student'] = seat.loc[i + 1, 'student'], seat.loc[i, 'student']

    seat['id'] = range(1, len(seat) + 1)

    return seat[['id', 'student']]
```

### Method 2 – Using DataFrame Slicing

```python
def exchange_seats_slice(seat: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    seat = seat.sort_values("id").reset_index(drop=True)
    students = seat['student'].tolist()

    for i in range(0, len(students) - 1, 2):
        students[i], students[i + 1] = students[i + 1], students[i]

    seat['student'] = students
    seat['id'] = range(1, len(seat) + 1)

    return seat[['id', 'student']]
```
