    customer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    visited_on DATE,
    amount INT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Customer;

INSERT INTO Customer (customer_id, name, visited_on, amount) VALUES
(1, 'Jhon', '2019-01-01', 100),
(2, 'Daniel', '2019-01-02', 110),

### Method 1: Subquery with aggregation

```
SELECT visited_on,
(
    SELECT SUM(amount)
    FROM Customer
    WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
) AS amount,
ROUND((
    SELECT SUM(amount)/7
    FROM Customer
    WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
), 2) AS average_amount
FROM Customer c
WHERE visited_on >= (
    SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
    FROM Customer
)
GROUP BY visited_on
ORDER BY visited_on;
```

### Method 2: Join and Grouping

```
SELECT 
    d.visited_on,
    SUM(a.amount) AS amount,
    ROUND(SUM(a.amount) / 7, 2) AS average_amount
FROM (
    SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) AS amount
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY visited_on
) a
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT visited_on
    FROM Customer
) d ON a.visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(d.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND d.visited_on
GROUP BY d.visited_on
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT a.visited_on) = 7
ORDER BY d.visited_on;
```

### Method 3: Window Functions

```
WITH daily_totals AS (
    SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) AS amount
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY visited_on
),
rolling_7_days AS (
    SELECT 
        visited_on,
        SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS amount,
        ROUND(AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS average_amount
    FROM daily_totals
)
SELECT *
FROM rolling_7_days
WHERE visited_on >= (
    SELECT MIN(visited_on) + INTERVAL 6 DAY
    FROM daily_totals
)
ORDER BY visited_on;
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
data = [
    [1, 'Jhon', '2019-01-01', 100],
    [2, 'Daniel', '2019-01-02', 110],
    [3, 'Jade', '2019-01-03', 120],
    [4, 'Khaled', '2019-01-04', 130],
    [5, 'Winston', '2019-01-05', 110],
    [6, 'Elvis', '2019-01-06', 140],
    [7, 'Anna', '2019-01-07', 150],
    [8, 'Maria', '2019-01-08', 80],
    [9, 'Jaze', '2019-01-09', 110],
    [1, 'Jhon', '2019-01-10', 130],
    [3, 'Jade', '2019-01-10', 150]
]
customer = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['customer_id', 'name', 'visited_on', 'amount'])
customer['visited_on'] = pd.to_datetime(customer['visited_on'])
```

## Pandas Solutions

### Method 1: Grouping and Rolling

```python
def restaurant_growth(customer: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    customer['visited_on'] = pd.to_datetime(customer['visited_on'])
    daily = customer.groupby('visited_on', as_index=False)['amount'].sum()
    daily = daily.sort_values('visited_on')
    daily['amount_7d'] = daily['amount'].rolling(window=7).sum()
    daily['average_amount'] = daily['amount_7d'].div(7).round(2)
    result = daily[daily['average_amount'].notnull()].copy()
    result = result[['visited_on', 'amount_7d', 'average_amount']]
    result.columns = ['visited_on', 'amount', 'average_amount']
    return result
```

### Method 2: Simplified Rolling

```python
def restaurant_growth(customer: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    customer['visited_on'] = pd.to_datetime(customer['visited_on'])
    daily = customer.groupby('visited_on', as_index=False)['amount'].sum().sort_values('visited_on')
    daily['average_amount'] = daily['amount'].rolling(window=7).mean().round(2)
    daily['amount'] = daily['amount'].rolling(window=7).sum()
    result = daily[daily['average_amount'].notnull()].reset_index(drop=True)
    return result[['visited_on', 'amount', 'average_amount']]
```
