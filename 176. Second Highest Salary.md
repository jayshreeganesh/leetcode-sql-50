# Second Highest Salary Solutions

This document contains SQL and Pandas queries to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. Solutions are provided for various database systems including MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Python Pandas.

## SQL Schema and Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (
    id INT,
    salary INT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;

INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary) VALUES (1, 100);
INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary) VALUES (2, 200);
INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary) VALUES (3, 300);
```

---

## MySQL Queries

**Method 1: Using NOT IN**
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```

**Method 2: Using Subquery with OFFSET**
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

---

## MS SQL Server Queries

**Method 1: Using TOP and MAX**
```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT TOP 2 salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
) AS Temp
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee
);
```

---

## Oracle Queries

**Method 1: Using DENSE_RANK()**
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
)
WHERE rnk = 2;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Queries

**Method 1: Using OFFSET and LIMIT**
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY salary DESC
     OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

---

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [[1, 100], [2, 200], [3, 300]]
employee = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['id', 'salary']).astype({'id':'int64', 'salary':'int64'})
```

---

## Pandas Queries

**Method 1: Basic approach**
```python
import pandas as pd

def second_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    unique_salaries = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates().sort_values(ascending=False)
    second_highest = unique_salaries.iloc[1] if len(unique_salaries) > 1 else None
    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [second_highest]})
```

**Method 2: Extended with check**
```python
import pandas as pd

def second_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Drop duplicates and sort salaries in descending order
    unique_salaries = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates().sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    # Check if there is a second highest salary
    if len(unique_salaries) >= 2:
        second_highest = unique_salaries.iloc[1]
    else:
        second_highest = None  # Return None if no second highest salary
    
    # Return in required format
    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [second_highest]})
```
