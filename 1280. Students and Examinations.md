# Students and Examinations Query

This project demonstrates how to query the number of examinations attended by each student for every subject using different SQL dialects and Pandas.

## SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Students (student_id INT, student_name VARCHAR(20));
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Subjects (subject_name VARCHAR(20));
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Examinations (student_id INT, subject_name VARCHAR(20));

TRUNCATE TABLE Students;
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, student_name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(13, 'John'),
(6, 'Alex');

TRUNCATE TABLE Subjects;
INSERT INTO Subjects (subject_name) VALUES
('Math'),
('Physics'),
('Programming');

TRUNCATE TABLE Examinations;
INSERT INTO Examinations (student_id, subject_name) VALUES
(1, 'Math'), (1, 'Physics'), (1, 'Programming'), (2, 'Programming'),
(1, 'Physics'), (1, 'Math'), (13, 'Math'), (13, 'Programming'),
(13, 'Physics'), (2, 'Math'), (1, 'Math');
```

## Queries by Database

### MySQL 8.0

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND e.subject_name = sub.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, s.student_name;
```

### Microsoft SQL Server 2019

```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e 
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

### Oracle SQL 11.2

```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e 
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

### PostgreSQL 16

```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e 
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

## Pandas Implementation

### Schema

```python
import pandas as pd

students = pd.DataFrame([
    [1, 'Alice'],
    [2, 'Bob'],
    [13, 'John'],
    [6, 'Alex']
], columns=['student_id', 'student_name']).astype({'student_id': 'Int64', 'student_name': 'object'})

subjects = pd.DataFrame([
    ['Math'],
    ['Physics'],
    ['Programming']
], columns=['subject_name']).astype({'subject_name': 'object'})

examinations = pd.DataFrame([
    [1, 'Math'], [1, 'Physics'], [1, 'Programming'], [2, 'Programming'],
    [1, 'Physics'], [1, 'Math'], [13, 'Math'], [13, 'Programming'],
    [13, 'Physics'], [2, 'Math'], [1, 'Math']
], columns=['student_id', 'subject_name']).astype({'student_id': 'Int64', 'subject_name': 'object'})
```

### Query

```python
def students_and_examinations(students: pd.DataFrame, subjects: pd.DataFrame, examinations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    s1 = students.merge(subjects, how="cross")
    s2 = examinations.groupby(["student_id", "subject_name"]).size().reset_index(name="attended_exams")
    s3 = s1.merge(s2, how="left", on=["student_id", "subject_name"])
    s3["attended_exams"].fillna(0, inplace=True)
    return s3.sort_values(["student_id", "subject_name"])
```

## Output

Each row in the final output represents the number of times a student has attended an exam for a particular subject.
