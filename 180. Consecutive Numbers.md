# Consecutive Numbers Detection

This README provides schema, data, and multiple query solutions for detecting three or more consecutive rows with the same number from a `Logs` table using various databases and Pandas.

---

## SQL Schema and Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Logs (id INT, num INT);
TRUNCATE TABLE Logs;

INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (2, 1);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (3, 1);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (4, 2);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (5, 1);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (6, 2);
INSERT INTO Logs (id, num) VALUES (7, 2);
```

## MySQL Queries

### Method 1: Self Join
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id - 2
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
```

### Method 2: Comma Join
```sql
SELECT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.id - l2.id = 1
  AND l2.id - l3.id = 1
  AND l1.num = l2.num
  AND l2.num = l3.num
GROUP BY l1.num;
```

---

## MS SQL Server Queries

### Method 1: Self Join
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id - 2
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
```

### Method 2: Window Functions
```sql
WITH LogWindow AS (
  SELECT *,
         LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
         LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev2
  FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM LogWindow
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = prev2;
```

---

## Oracle SQL Queries

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
  SELECT num,
         LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
         LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev2
  FROM Logs
)
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = prev2;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Queries

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
  SELECT num,
         LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
         LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev2
  FROM Logs
) sub
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = prev2;
```

---

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 2], [5, 1], [6, 2], [7, 2]]
logs = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['id', 'num']).astype({'id': 'Int64', 'num': 'Int64'})
```

---

## Pandas Queries

### Method 1: Using `shift()` and filtering

```python
def consecutive_numbers(logs: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    logs = logs.sort_values(by='id')
    logs['prev1'] = logs['num'].shift(1)
    logs['prev2'] = logs['num'].shift(2)
    consecutive = logs[(logs['num'] == logs['prev1']) & (logs['num'] == logs['prev2'])]
    return consecutive[['num']].drop_duplicates().rename(columns={'num': 'ConsecutiveNums'})
```

---

## Output Example

For the input data, the result will be:

```text
ConsecutiveNums
1
```
