# Insurance Query Solutions

This README provides SQL and Pandas solutions to a data filtering problem involving the `Insurance` table. The goal is to calculate the sum of `tiv_2016` for policies that meet two criteria:

1. `tiv_2015` value appears more than once.
2. The `(lat, lon)` location is unique.

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Insurance (
    pid INT,
    tiv_2015 FLOAT,
    tiv_2016 FLOAT,
    lat FLOAT,
    lon FLOAT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Insurance;

INSERT INTO Insurance (pid, tiv_2015, tiv_2016, lat, lon) VALUES 
(1, 10, 5, 10, 10),
(2, 20, 20, 20, 20),
(3, 10, 30, 20, 20),
(4, 10, 40, 40, 40);
```

## SQL Queries

### MySQL 8.0

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

### MS SQL Server 2019

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND CONCAT(lat, ',', lon) IN (
    SELECT CONCAT(lat, ',', lon) FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

### Oracle SQL 11.2

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

### PostgreSQL 16

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016)::numeric, 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 10, 5, 10, 10],
    [2, 20, 20, 20, 20],
    [3, 10, 30, 20, 20],
    [4, 10, 40, 40, 40]
]

insurance = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['pid', 'tiv_2015', 'tiv_2016', 'lat', 'lon']).astype({
    'pid': 'Int64',
    'tiv_2015': 'Float64',
    'tiv_2016': 'Float64',
    'lat': 'Float64',
    'lon': 'Float64'
})
```

## Pandas Query Solution

```python
def find_investments(insurance: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Step 1: Filter policies with duplicate tiv_2015
    duplicate_tiv_2015 = insurance[insurance.duplicated('tiv_2015', keep=False)]

    # Step 2: Identify unique (lat, lon) pairs
    location_counts = insurance.groupby(['lat', 'lon']).size().reset_index(name='count')
    unique_locations = location_counts[location_counts['count'] == 1][['lat', 'lon']]

    # Step 3: Merge to get records with duplicate tiv_2015 AND unique (lat, lon)
    filtered = pd.merge(duplicate_tiv_2015, unique_locations, on=['lat', 'lon'])

    # Step 4: Sum tiv_2016 and round to two decimal places
    total = round(filtered['tiv_2016'].sum(), 2)

    # Step 5: Return as DataFrame
    return pd.DataFrame({'tiv_2016': [total]})
```

## Output Example

The expected output for the above data is:

```
tiv_2016
--------
40.00
```
