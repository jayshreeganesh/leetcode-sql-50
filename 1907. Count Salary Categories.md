# Salary Category Count

This project analyzes account income data and categorizes accounts based on their salary into three categories:

- **Low Salary**: income < 20,000  
- **Average Salary**: income between 20,000 and 50,000  
- **High Salary**: income > 50,000

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts (
    account_id INT,
    income INT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Accounts;

INSERT INTO Accounts (account_id, income) VALUES
(3, 108939),
(2, 12747),
(8, 87709),
(6, 91796);
```

## SQL Queries

### MySQL

#### Method 1: Using `IF` and `SUM`
```sql
SELECT "Low Salary" AS category,
       SUM(IF(income < 20000, 1, 0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
UNION
SELECT "Average Salary",
       SUM(IF(income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000, 1, 0))
FROM Accounts
UNION
SELECT "High Salary",
       SUM(IF(income > 50000, 1, 0))
FROM Accounts;
```

#### Method 2: Using `WHERE` and `UNION ALL`
```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income < 20000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000;
```

---

### MS SQL Server

```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts WHERE income < 20000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000;
```

---

### Oracle SQL

```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts WHERE income < 20000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000;
```

---

### PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts WHERE income < 20000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary', COUNT(*)
FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000;
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [[3, 108939], [2, 12747], [8, 87709], [6, 91796]]
accounts = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['account_id', 'income']).astype({'account_id':'Int64', 'income':'Int64'})
```

## Pandas Queries

### Method 1: Using Boolean Filtering
```python
def count_salary_categories(accounts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    low_count = accounts[accounts['income'] < 20000].shape[0]
    average_count = accounts[(accounts['income'] >= 20000) & (accounts['income'] <= 50000)].shape[0]
    high_count = accounts[accounts['income'] > 50000].shape[0]

    result = pd.DataFrame({
        'category': ['Low Salary', 'Average Salary', 'High Salary'],
        'accounts_count': [low_count, average_count, high_count]
    })

    return result
```

### Method 2: Using `pd.cut` and `groupby`
```python
def count_salary_categories_with_cut(accounts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    bins = [float('-inf'), 20000, 50000, float('inf')]
    labels = ['Low Salary', 'Average Salary', 'High Salary']
    accounts['category'] = pd.cut(accounts['income'], bins=bins, labels=labels)
    result = accounts.groupby('category').size().reset_index(name='accounts_count')
    return result
```
