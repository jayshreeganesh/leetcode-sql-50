# Employee Primary Department Queries

This document provides SQL and Pandas solutions to determine the primary department for employees based on a set of business rules. The rules are:
- If an employee has only one department, return that department.
- If an employee has multiple departments, return the one with `primary_flag = 'Y'`.

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (
    employee_id INT,
    department_id INT,
    primary_flag ENUM('Y', 'N')
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;

INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, department_id, primary_flag) VALUES 
(1, 1, 'N'),
(2, 1, 'Y'),
(2, 2, 'N'),
(3, 3, 'N'),
(4, 2, 'N'),
(4, 3, 'Y'),
(4, 4, 'N');
```

## MySQL Query

### Method 1: Using `UNION`
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
GROUP BY employee_id, department_id

UNION

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id, department_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1;
```

## Microsoft SQL Server Query

### Method 1: Using CTE with `COUNT(*) OVER()`
```sql
WITH DepartmentCount AS (
    SELECT employee_id, department_id, primary_flag,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id) AS dept_count
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM DepartmentCount
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR dept_count = 1;
```

## Oracle SQL Query

### Method 1: Using `UNION ALL`
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION ALL

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

---

## PostgreSQL Query

### Method 1: Using `UNION`
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    ['1', '1', 'N'],
    ['2', '1', 'Y'],
    ['2', '2', 'N'],
    ['3', '3', 'N'],
    ['4', '2', 'N'],
    ['4', '3', 'Y'],
    ['4', '4', 'N']
]

employee = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['employee_id', 'department_id', 'primary_flag']).astype({
    'employee_id': 'Int64',
    'department_id': 'Int64',
    'primary_flag': 'object'
})
```

---

## Pandas Query

### Method 1: Using `value_counts` and filtering

```python
def find_primary_department(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Count departments per employee
    dept_counts = employee['employee_id'].value_counts()

    # Employees with only one department
    single_dept_employees = dept_counts[dept_counts == 1].index
    single_dept = employee[employee['employee_id'].isin(single_dept_employees)]

    # Employees with multiple departments, pick only primary_flag == 'Y'
    multi_dept = employee[
        (employee['employee_id'].isin(dept_counts[dept_counts > 1].index)) &
        (employee['primary_flag'] == 'Y')
    ]

    # Combine and sort by employee_id
    result = pd.concat([single_dept, multi_dept])[['employee_id', 'department_id']]
    result = result.sort_values(by='employee_id').reset_index(drop=True)
    return result
```
