# Query Statistics Report

This document provides SQL schema, data insertion statements, and query solutions for multiple relational database systems including MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, as well as a Pandas solution in Python.

## SQL Schema and Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Queries (
    query_name VARCHAR(30),
    result VARCHAR(50),
    position INT,
    rating INT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Queries;

INSERT INTO Queries (query_name, result, position, rating) VALUES 
('Dog', 'Golden Retriever', 1, 5),
('Dog', 'German Shepherd', 2, 5),
('Dog', 'Mule', 200, 1),
('Cat', 'Shirazi', 5, 2),
('Cat', 'Siamese', 3, 3),
('Cat', 'Sphynx', 7, 4);
```

## MySQL Queries

### Method 1: Using `CASE WHEN`

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating * 1.0 / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

### Method 2: Using `IF`

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(AVG(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
WHERE 
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

### Method 3: Alternative AVG & Logical Check

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(AVG((rating < 3) * 100), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

---

## MS SQL Server Query

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(rating AS FLOAT) / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

---

## Oracle SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating * 1.0 / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating::numeric / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

---

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    ['Dog', 'Golden Retriever', 1, 5],
    ['Dog', 'German Shepherd', 2, 5],
    ['Dog', 'Mule', 200, 1],
    ['Cat', 'Shirazi', 5, 2],
    ['Cat', 'Siamese', 3, 3],
    ['Cat', 'Sphynx', 7, 4]
]

queries = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['query_name', 'result', 'position', 'rating']).astype({
    'query_name': 'object', 
    'result': 'object', 
    'position': 'Int64', 
    'rating': 'Int64'
})
```

## Pandas Query

```python
def queries_stats(queries: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    queries['quality'] = queries['rating'] / queries['position'] + 1e-6
    queries['poor_query_percentage'] = (queries['rating'] < 3) * 100
    out = queries.groupby(['query_name']).agg({
        'quality': 'mean',
        'poor_query_percentage': 'mean'
    }).round(2).reset_index()
    return out
```

All implementations calculate two key metrics per `query_name`:
- **Quality**: Average of rating divided by position.
- **Poor Query Percentage**: Percentage of results with rating less than 3.
