## 🐬 MySQL Queries (v8.0)

### ✅ Method 1: Using subquery and group by

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
);
```

### ✅ Method 2: Using inner select

```sql
SELECT
ROUND(SUM(IF(min_order_date = min_customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) * 100 / COUNT(min_order_date), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT 
        delivery_id, 
        customer_id, 
        MIN(order_date) AS min_order_date,
        MIN(customer_pref_delivery_date) AS min_customer_pref_delivery_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS new_table;
```

        FROM Delivery
        WHERE customer_id = d.customer_id
    )
)
SELECT 
    CAST(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS NUMERIC(5,2)) AS immediate_percentage
FROM FirstOrders;

## 🐍 Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 1, '2019-08-01', '2019-08-02'],
    [2, 2, '2019-08-02', '2019-08-02'],
    [3, 1, '2019-08-11', '2019-08-12'],
    [4, 3, '2019-08-24', '2019-08-24'],
    [5, 3, '2019-08-21', '2019-08-22'],
    [6, 2, '2019-08-11', '2019-08-13'],
    [7, 4, '2019-08-09', '2019-08-09']
]

delivery = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[
    'delivery_id', 'customer_id', 'order_date', 'customer_pref_delivery_date'
]).astype({
    'delivery_id':'Int64', 
    'customer_id':'Int64', 
    'order_date':'datetime64[ns]', 
    'customer_pref_delivery_date':'datetime64[ns]'
})
```

## 🐼 Pandas Query

### ✅ Method 1: Using `groupby` and `idxmin`

```python
def immediate_food_delivery(delivery: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Find the first order per customer
    first_orders = delivery.loc[delivery.groupby('customer_id')['order_date'].idxmin()]

    # Calculate immediate delivery count and total
    immediate_count = (first_orders['order_date'] == first_orders['customer_pref_delivery_date']).sum()
    total_count = len(first_orders)

    immediate_percentage = round(immediate_count * 100 / total_count, 2)

    return pd.DataFrame({'immediate_percentage': [immediate_percentage]})
```

## 📌 Notes

- This solution is platform-agnostic and works on most relational databases with minor syntax variations.
- Pandas is useful for prototyping or running the same logic in Python environments.
