# Top 3 Salaries Per Department - Multi-Database and Pandas Solutions

This document provides SQL schemas, sample data, and solutions to retrieve the top 3 salaries in each department using various database systems and Python (Pandas).

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
-- Employee Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary INT,
    departmentId INT
);

-- Department Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Department (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Sample Data
TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;
INSERT INTO Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) VALUES
(1, 'Joe', 85000, 1),
(2, 'Henry', 80000, 2),
(3, 'Sam', 60000, 2),
(4, 'Max', 90000, 1),
(5, 'Janet', 69000, 1),
(6, 'Randy', 85000, 1),
(7, 'Will', 70000, 1);

TRUNCATE TABLE Department;
INSERT INTO Department (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'IT'),
(2, 'Sales');
```

## MySQL Query

### Method 1: Using `DENSE_RANK()` and Subquery

```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
) e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

### Method 2: Using `LEFT JOIN` and Subquery

```sql
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary FROM (
    SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS ranks
    FROM Employee e
    LEFT JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
) temp
WHERE ranks <= 3;
```

---

## MS SQL Server Query

```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
) e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

---

## Oracle SQL Query

```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT e.*, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee e
) e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Query

```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
) e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Employee DataFrame
employee_data = [
    [1, 'Joe', 85000, 1],
    [2, 'Henry', 80000, 2],
    [3, 'Sam', 60000, 2],
    [4, 'Max', 90000, 1],
    [5, 'Janet', 69000, 1],
    [6, 'Randy', 85000, 1],
    [7, 'Will', 70000, 1]
]
employee = pd.DataFrame(employee_data, columns=['id', 'name', 'salary', 'departmentId'])

# Department DataFrame
department_data = [
    [1, 'IT'],
    [2, 'Sales']
]
department = pd.DataFrame(department_data, columns=['id', 'name'])
```

---

## Pandas Solution

### Method 1: Using `rank()`

```python
def top_three_salaries(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged_df = employee.merge(department, left_on='departmentId', right_on='id', suffixes=('', '_dept'))
    merged_df['rank'] = merged_df.groupby('departmentId')['salary'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)
    top_earners = merged_df[merged_df['rank'] <= 3]
    result = top_earners[['name_dept', 'name', 'salary']]
    result.columns = ['Department', 'Employee', 'Salary']
    return result
```

### Method 2: Using `nlargest` with `groupby().apply()`

```python
def top_three_salaries_nlargest(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged = employee.merge(department, left_on='departmentId', right_on='id')
    top3 = merged.groupby('departmentId', group_keys=False).apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(3, 'salary'))
    return top3[['name_y', 'name_x', 'salary']].rename(columns={'name_y': 'Department', 'name_x': 'Employee'})
```
