# Product Sales Summary by Sell Date

This document contains SQL and Pandas solutions to summarize product sales by sell date. It includes schema definitions, sample data, and multiple query solutions for each database system (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) and Pandas.

## 🗃️ SQL Schema and Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Activities (
    sell_date DATE, 
    product VARCHAR(20)
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Activities;

INSERT INTO Activities (sell_date, product) VALUES 
('2020-05-30', 'Headphone'),
('2020-06-01', 'Pencil'),
('2020-06-02', 'Mask'),
('2020-05-30', 'Basketball'),
('2020-06-01', 'Bible'),
('2020-06-02', 'Mask'),
('2020-05-30', 'T-Shirt');
```

## 🐬 MySQL Query (MySQL 8.0)

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

---

## 💼 MS SQL Server Query (MSSQL 2019)

```sql
WITH DistinctProducts AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT sell_date, product
    FROM Activities
)
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(*) AS num_sold,
    STRING_AGG(product, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM DistinctProducts
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

---

## 🏛️ Oracle SQL Query (Oracle 11.2)

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sell_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "sell_date",
    COUNT(*) AS "num_sold",
    LISTAGG(product, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY product) AS "products"
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT TRUNC(sell_date) AS sell_date, product
    FROM Activities
)
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

---

## 🐘 PostgreSQL Query (PostgreSQL 16)

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(*) AS num_sold,
    STRING_AGG(product, ',' ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT sell_date::DATE AS sell_date, product
    FROM Activities
) AS dp
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

---

## 🐼 Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    ['2020-05-30', 'Headphone'],
    ['2020-06-01', 'Pencil'],
    ['2020-06-02', 'Mask'],
    ['2020-05-30', 'Basketball'],
    ['2020-06-01', 'Bible'],
    ['2020-06-02', 'Mask'],
    ['2020-05-30', 'T-Shirt']
]

activities = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['sell_date', 'product']).astype({
    'sell_date': 'datetime64[ns]',
    'product': 'object'
})
```

## 🧮 Pandas Query

```python
def categorize_products(activities: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Format sell_date to 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    activities['sell_date'] = pd.to_datetime(activities['sell_date']).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

    # Drop duplicate (sell_date, product) combinations
    unique_activities = activities.drop_duplicates()

    # Group and aggregate by sell_date
    result = (
        unique_activities
        .groupby('sell_date', as_index=False)
        .agg(
            num_sold=('product', 'nunique'),
            products=('product', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))
        )
        .sort_values('sell_date')
    )
    return result
```
