# Gameplay Analysis

This document contains SQL schemas, data, and multiple query solutions for analyzing player login behavior across various database systems and using Pandas in Python.

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Activity (
    player_id INT,
    device_id INT,
    event_date DATE,
    games_played INT
);

TRUNCATE TABLE Activity;

INSERT INTO Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) VALUES 
(1, 2, '2016-03-01', 5),
(1, 2, '2016-03-02', 6),
(2, 3, '2017-06-25', 1),
(3, 1, '2016-03-02', 0),
(3, 4, '2018-07-03', 5);
```

## MySQL Queries

### Method 1
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(player_login) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM (
    SELECT player_id,
           DATEDIFF(event_date, MIN(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id)) = 1 AS player_login
    FROM Activity
) AS new_table;
```

### Method 2
```sql
SELECT 
ROUND(
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id)
     FROM Activity a
     JOIN (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_logged FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id) b 
     ON DATEDIFF(a.event_date, b.first_logged) = 1 AND a.player_id = b.player_id)
    / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction;
```

### Method 3
```sql
WITH T AS (
    SELECT player_id,
           DATEDIFF(LEAD(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date), event_date) = 1 AS st,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS rk
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(IF(st = 1, player_id, NULL)) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM T WHERE rk = 1;
```

## Microsoft SQL Server Queries

### Method 1
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN DATEADD(DAY,1,a.event_date) = b.event_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*1.00 / COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS event_date FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id) a
JOIN Activity b ON a.player_id = b.player_id;
```

### Method 2
```sql
WITH DT AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS min_date FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id
),
FT AS (
    SELECT player_id, event_date FROM (
        SELECT player_id, event_date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS rk 
        FROM Activity) a WHERE rk = 2
)
SELECT CONVERT(DECIMAL(6,2), COUNT(DT.player_id)*1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity)) AS fraction
FROM DT LEFT JOIN FT ON DT.player_id = FT.player_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, min_date, FT.event_date) = 1;
```

## Oracle SQL Queries

### Method 1
```sql
WITH FirstLogin AS (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id
),
NextDayLogin AS (
  SELECT a.player_id
  FROM Activity a
  JOIN FirstLogin f ON a.player_id = f.player_id AND a.event_date = f.first_login + 1
)
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT n.player_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT f.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM FirstLogin f
LEFT JOIN NextDayLogin n ON f.player_id = n.player_id;
```

---

## PostgreSQL Queries

### Method 1
```sql
WITH FirstLogin AS (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id
),
NextDayLogin AS (
  SELECT a.player_id
  FROM Activity a
  JOIN FirstLogin f ON a.player_id = f.player_id AND a.event_date = f.first_login + INTERVAL '1 day'
)
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT n.player_id)::NUMERIC / COUNT(DISTINCT f.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM FirstLogin f
LEFT JOIN NextDayLogin n ON f.player_id = n.player_id;
```

## Pandas Schema and Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 2, '2016-03-01', 5],
    [1, 2, '2016-03-02', 6],
    [2, 3, '2017-06-25', 1],
    [3, 1, '2016-03-02', 0],
    [3, 4, '2018-07-03', 5]
]
activity = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['player_id', 'device_id', 'event_date', 'games_played']).astype({
    'player_id': 'Int64',
    'device_id': 'Int64',
    'event_date': 'datetime64[ns]',
    'games_played': 'Int64'
})
```

### Method 1
```python
def gameplay_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    activity["first"] = activity.groupby("player_id").event_date.transform(min)
    activity_2nd_day = activity[activity["first"] + pd.DateOffset(1) == activity["event_date"]]
    return pd.DataFrame({"fraction": [round(len(activity_2nd_day) / activity.player_id.nunique(), 2)]})
```

### Method 2
```python
def gameplay_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    activity['event_date'] = pd.to_datetime(activity['event_date'])
    first_login = activity.groupby('player_id')['event_date'].min().reset_index()
    first_login.columns = ['player_id', 'first_login']
    merged = activity.merge(first_login, on='player_id')
    merged['next_day'] = merged['first_login'] + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    next_day_players = merged[merged['event_date'] == merged['next_day']]['player_id'].nunique()
    total_players = activity['player_id'].nunique()
    fraction = round(next_day_players / total_players, 2)
    return pd.DataFrame({'fraction': [fraction]})
```
