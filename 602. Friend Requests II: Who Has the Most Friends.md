# Most Friends Query Solutions

This document provides a unified schema and multiple query solutions to determine the user with the most friends from a `RequestAccepted` table. Implementations are provided for various SQL engines and Pandas (Python).

## SQL Schema and Sample Data

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS RequestAccepted (
    requester_id INT NOT NULL,
    accepter_id INT NULL,
    accept_date DATE NULL
);

TRUNCATE TABLE RequestAccepted;

INSERT INTO RequestAccepted (requester_id, accepter_id, accept_date) VALUES (1, 2, '2016/06/03');
INSERT INTO RequestAccepted (requester_id, accepter_id, accept_date) VALUES (1, 3, '2016/06/08');
INSERT INTO RequestAccepted (requester_id, accepter_id, accept_date) VALUES (2, 3, '2016/06/08');
INSERT INTO RequestAccepted (requester_id, accepter_id, accept_date) VALUES (3, 4, '2016/06/09');
```

## MySQL 8.0

**Method 1: Using `UNION ALL` and `GROUP BY`**

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(id) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) temp
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Method 2: With CTE**

```sql
WITH friend_counts AS (
    SELECT id, SUM(cnt) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY requester_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY accepter_id
    ) t
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM friend_counts
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Microsoft SQL Server 2019

```sql
WITH friend_counts AS (
    SELECT id, SUM(cnt) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY requester_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY accepter_id
    ) t
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT TOP 1 id, num
FROM friend_counts
ORDER BY num DESC;
```

## Oracle SQL 11.2

```sql
WITH friend_counts AS (
    SELECT id, SUM(cnt) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY requester_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY accepter_id
    ) t
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM (
    SELECT id, num, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY num DESC) AS rnk
    FROM friend_counts
)
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

---

## PostgreSQL 16

```sql
WITH friend_counts AS (
    SELECT id, SUM(cnt) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY requester_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted GROUP BY accepter_id
    ) t
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM friend_counts
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Pandas Schema and Sample Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    [1, 2, '2016/06/03'],
    [1, 3, '2016/06/08'],
    [2, 3, '2016/06/08'],
    [3, 4, '2016/06/09']
]

request_accepted = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['requester_id', 'accepter_id', 'accept_date']).astype({
    'requester_id': 'Int64',
    'accepter_id': 'Int64',
    'accept_date': 'datetime64[ns]'
})
```

---

## Pandas Query Solution

```python
def most_friends(request_accepted: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Count friends from requester_id and accepter_id
    requester_counts = request_accepted['requester_id'].value_counts().reset_index()
    accepter_counts = request_accepted['accepter_id'].value_counts().reset_index()
    
    # Rename columns for consistency
    requester_counts.columns = ['id', 'count']
    accepter_counts.columns = ['id', 'count']
    
    # Combine both counts
    combined = pd.concat([requester_counts, accepter_counts])
    
    # Sum the counts for each id
    friend_counts = combined.groupby('id')['count'].sum().reset_index()
    friend_counts.columns = ['id', 'num']
    
    # Get the row with maximum count
    max_friends = friend_counts['num'].max()
    result = friend_counts[friend_counts['num'] == max_friends]
    
    return result
```
